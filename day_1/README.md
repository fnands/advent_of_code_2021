## Things I learned:


* `readdlm` (delimited read) will deal with delimeters and read values out of file as an array

* Iteration is much like Python, but Julia counts from 1 by default

* You don't need an explicit return statement in Julia, functions will return the last evaluated expression 

* List comprehenstions much like python, but with round not square brackets
