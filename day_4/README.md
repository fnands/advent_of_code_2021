## Things I learned:


* I tried the CSV package instead of DelimitedFiles as I could choose the amount of lines to read easily 

* DataFrames in Julia similar to pandas

* Had to mess around with reshape and permutedims a bit to get array in right order. Need to figure out why values ended up in different order than I naively expected. 

* `replace` is a super useful function
