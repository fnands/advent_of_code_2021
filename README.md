# Advent of code 2021


These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021).  

Like many people, I'm using the challenge to get to know that language that you've been wanting to try out all year, but haven't had the chance to. For me that's [Julia](https://julialang.org/) this year. I did attend a (short) introduction at a workshop in 2019, but I can't remember anything. 

I really don't know Julia, which is great as the challenges start pretty simple.  

I don't want to spend a huge amount of time on the challenge, so these solutions will be the first working way I come up with, and are by no means optimized or clean or good in any sense of the word. I have a perfectionist streak that I must supress by just moving on.    

My philosophy here is to find a solution and then afterwards compare that to how other people have done it, but I won't update my solutions.   

I hope by the end of this challenge I will get used to the Julian way of doing things, because I suspect my first few solutions might be a bit Pythonic.

Using Julia 1.7.0
